A full-stack task manager application built to practice backend, frontend, and DevOps fundamentals.
The backend is implemented with FastAPI and SQLite, providing a REST API for managing tasks (CRUD).
The frontend is built with React and communicates with the backend via HTTP.
Both services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, following a production-like setup with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

Tech stack: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, React, Vite, Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx.
